# Simple Blockchain Implementation in JavaScript

This is a basic blockchain implementation in JavaScript using Node.js. It includes:

- Transaction creation and signing with elliptic curve cryptography (`secp256k1`).
- Block mining with proof-of-work (simple difficulty target).
- Chain validation and balance tracking.

---

## Features

- Create transactions between wallets.
- Sign transactions with private keys to ensure authenticity.
- Mine blocks to add pending transactions to the blockchain.
- Earn mining rewards.
- Check wallet balances.
- Validate the integrity of the blockchain.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- `crypto-js` for SHA256 hashing
- `elliptic` for elliptic curve cryptography (ECDSA signing/verifying)
